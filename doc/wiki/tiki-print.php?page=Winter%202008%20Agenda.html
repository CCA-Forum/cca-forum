<b>Changing Dates for the October 2008 Forum Meeting</b><br />
Rob Armstrong, SNL<br />
<br />
The CompArch meeting, which includes CBSE and the Component-Based HPC workshop (formerly known as CompFrame) is 14-17 October, which overlaps with the originally-planned dates for the CCA Forum meeting (16-17 October). We need to shift the Forum meeting to allow participation in both events.<br />

Masha Sosonkina<br />
<br />
I will introduce the Many Fermion Dynamics MFDn applications, outline its computational requirements, and present some use cases involving MFDn. Initial component modeling and port designations will be also shown.<br />
<br />
<b><a class="wiki"  href="http://www.cca-forum.org/download/mtg/2008-01/ccaTalkBoulder.ppt">Babel F2003 Struct Support update and FACETS+Babel integration</a></b><br />
Stefan Muszala, Tech-X<br />
<br />
The purpose of this talk is to provide a technical update regarding the implementation of F2003 Struct Support in Babel (What's done, What needs to be done).  I will also describe our initial experience using the newly developed Babel bindings in work that integrates FACETS C++ framework codes with FMCFM Fortran transport modules.<br />
<br />
<b>Bocca User Request/Complaints Discussion</b><br />
Wael Elwsif, ORNL<br />
<br />
In light of the recently completed Toolkit coding camp, what are user issues regarding actual component creation from existing/new code?<br />

David Bernholdt, ORNL<br />
<br />
We <i>almost</i> have some progress to report in the much-delayed migration from the old cca-forum.org server at LBL to the new one at ORNL.  I'll give a preview of the process that we'll be going through establish shell accounts on the new server and migrate CVS/SVN repositories and login services.<br />
<br />
<b>Preview of the New TASCS Web Site</b><br />
David Bernholdt, ORNL<br />
<br />
In response to a meeting with SciDAC managers in October, we've setup a separate web site (from www.cca-forum.org) to show off the TASCS project. It is still under development, but should go into production around the end of the month.  I will give a short tour of the site as a teaser for tomorrow's BOF.<br />

<a class="wiki"  href="http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~mstrout/">Michelle Mills Strout</a>, Colorado State University (presented by Boyana Norris, ANL, due to illness)<br />
<br />
Source code transformations, such as generating component wrappers (semi)automatically from legacy libraries, require different types of program analysis. Compilers normally implement these analyses in an tightly-integrated, language-dependent manner. <a class="wiki"  href="https://openanalysis.berlios.de/">OpenAnalysis</a> is an open-source, language-independent program analysis system currently being used to analyze programs in the C/C++ ROSE compiler Sage intermediate representation and the Open64 Fortran compiler Whirl representation.  I will present an overview of the OpenAnalysis project and its current status.<br />

John Cary, Tech-X<br />
<br />
In the integrated computations of fusion devices, examples of many kinds of parallelism and parallel component models arise.  By way of background, integrated computations are those that try to combine in a single computational model the the disparate models that from the multiple physical aspects of a fusion device.  Those include turbulence, cross-flux-surface transport, transport in the anisotropic edge, and atomic and molecular species trapped in walls.  When these models are brought together, there exist multiple ways of distributing the models across a parallel system, but in addition, there are multiple ways in which the models can interact, such that a different interfaces need to be exposed on different ranks.  The needs for constructing such a complex simulation are discussed.  Those include a language and discovery mechanisms.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:red;">3:00pm</span> <b><a class="wiki"  href="http://www.cca-forum.org/download/mtg/2008-01/hakim_cca_08.ppt">Architecture of the FACETS fusion framework</a></b><br />
Ammar Hakim, Tech-X<br />
<br />
In this talk the architecture of the FACETS fusion framework is described. FACETS aims to provide a generic framework to couple fusion components to do coupled modeling of large fusion devices. To enable the coupling the framework defines a number of key concepts. Among these are Components, Updaters, Updatables and Couplers. These concepts will be described in detail and examples of their use in actual fusion simulation will be given.<br />
