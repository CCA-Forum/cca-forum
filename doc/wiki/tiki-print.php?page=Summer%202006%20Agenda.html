<br />
<b>8:00am - Working Breakfast - Preliminary Open Working Group Discussions</b><br />
Food served across the hall - Agee Room - w/Omelet Station! :-D<br />
<br />
<b>Welcome and Does Tennessee Have Indoor Plumbing?</b><br />
Jeeeeeeeeeeeem Kohl, ORNL<br />
<br />
<b>Introductions</b><br />
Rob Armstrong, SNL (Rob won't be around at this time &mdash; probably get there at 11-12-ish &mdash; so David will take over in his role as Vice Poobah).<br />
<br />
<b>The Next CCA Meeting at Argonne</b><br />
Lois McInnes, ANL or designated surrogate<br />
<br />
<b>Site Selection and Scheduling for July 2007</b><br />
Rob Armstrong, SNL<br />
<br />
<b><a class="wiki"  href="http://www.cca-forum.org/download/mtg/2006-07/CCA-LISI-Interface.ppt">One Linear Solver Interface to Bind Them All</a></b><br />

<b><a class="wiki"  href="http://www.cca-forum.org/download/mtg/2006-07/Tech-XOverviewTASCS.ppt">Tech-X and CCA-related projects at Tech-X</a></b><br />
Sveta Shasharina, Tech-X<br />
<br />
Sveta will introduce the company, since Tech-X is a new CCA member.<br />
She will also briefly describe existing Tech-X projects that could be of interest.<br />
<br />
&gt; ~11:00am <b>Rob Armstrong: Poobah for Life?</b><br />
Rob Armstrong<br />
<br />
Rob will reveal that, in fact, he is the only thing the CCA has not approved of by vote.  Emboldened by the startling success that the imposition of democracy has had on the international scene, we will discuss his plans for ending the years of tyranny by holding free and fair elections for this prestigious post.  How the Poobah-ship should be handed over and what democratic institutions we will adopt are at issue (run-off elections? Vice Poobah?, swiftboating?).  Nominations for the next Poobah will be sought at this meeting.  Originally I wanted to have the elections at this meeting but it does not seem fair to the candidates to have to campaign and get elected in a day.  Tentatively the election will proceed online or at the next CCA meeting.  This question will also be discussed.  A smoke-filled room will be made available for deal-making during Friday morning's BOF session.<br />

David Bernholdt, ORNL<br />
<br />
Things will be a lot different at SC this year.  Not only do we not have a tutorial to obsess over for the first time in five years, but ORNL has changed to a completely different booth design, so the era of the &quot;CCA Corner&quot; is also over.  I'll give you a peek at the new booth, and we'll discuss how to maximize our visibility and impact in this brave new world.<br />

There is a sign-up sheet to get on the Compframe Program Committee please contact <a class="wiki"  href="mailto:rob@sandia.gov">Rob</a>.  Currently we are discussing whether Compframe should be partnered with Geco again and whether it should be attached to another (bigger) conference.<br />
