<h3>The <a href="wiki/tiki-index.php%3Fpage=CcafeInstallNeo.html">Neo binding for Ccaffeine</a> is documented on the wiki.</h3>

<h3>This is a Common Component Architecture prototype framework for distributed
memory message passing High Performance Computing. The name <em> Ccaffeine
</em> no longer stands for anything in particular.  Ccaffeine is largely
a product of the High Performance Computing Research Division at Sandia National
Labs in Livermore, but also has benefited from many contributions from other
labs and Universities. &nbsp;This web page is to be converted to a weblog
as soon as I can get someone to install one Slashcode, in the meantime this
is something handtooled to tide us over.  Ccaffeine documentation can be found <a href="ccafe/ccaffeine-man.html"> here</a>.</h3>

<h3>Final feature set for SC03 Ccaffeine is in.</h3>
Decided to tag it "lemur" because that is an animal that Joe thinks is
    scary.  Quick checkout:
<pre>
cvs -d  $USER@cca-forum.org:/cvs/ccaffeine/repository co -r lemur ccafe
</pre>
A better description along with a complete build transcript is
    available <a href="ccafe/15Oct03.html">here</a>.
<p>
 Make sure you update the cca-spec-babel too, the new "goodbye kiss"
 pattern is in it per the last vote.  Note that Ccaffeine implements
 the <i>ComponentRelease</i> interface and no longer does a
 setServices with a null object to signal imminent destruction.
      Note also that the "classic" binding to Ccaffeine still behaves
      in the same way. 
</p>

<h3>Python install ready</h3>
<pre>
cvs -d  $USER@cca-forum.org:/cvs/ccaffeine/repository co -r Python ccafe
cvs -d  $USER@cca-forum.org:/cvs/cca-spec/repository co -r Python cca-spec-babel
</pre>
You need both the new cca-spec-babel and the new Ccaffeine.  Make sure
you have Python installed with the right Babelized libpython.so.  Then
use --with-babel-python in the configure for both cca-spec-babel and
for ccaffeine.  Let <a href="mailto:rob@sandia.gov">me</a> know if there is a problem.<br>

<h3> gcc >= 3.1 works with Ccaffeine now, important caveats though: </h3>


This information applies to the latest <a
href="http://cca-forum.org/download/ccafe/tutorial"> tar-ball </a>
which works fine with gcc 3.2.  If you are using Ccaffeine scripting
language (affectionately know as "BenSpeak") then please note that the
friendly people at Gnu have changed (corrected?) the way .so's are
loaded. You <em> must </em> use "repository get-global" where you
might have used (and gotten away with) "repository get" before.  This
has caused no end of problems even though Ben has warned us repeatedly
:-).  The major symptom is that components are successfully connected
and the port obtained through <em> getPort() </em>, but the <em>
dynamic_cast </em> fails for no apparent reason.  Using "repository
get-global" will fix this. <br> <br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">26Oct02<br>
<h3>A PortTranslator facility is now available, allowing the use of dynamic
parameters in components.</h3>
Download the latest tarball <a
 href="http://cca-forum.org/download/ccafe/tutorial">here</a>, or if your
feeling gutsy you can check out a fresh copy directly from CVS. &nbsp;If
you have access to the cca-forum.org machine do this:<br>
<br>
<pre>cvs -d $USER@cca-forum.org:/home/ccaffeine/repository co -r "babelification" ccafe</pre>
or just use <a href="ccafe/anoncvs.html">anonymous CVS</a> checkout.<br>
<br>
It should just build as usual, exactly the same as you already have it. &nbsp;<br>
I have accomplished this by creating a special Babel <b>gov::cca::Port</b>
called the PortTranslator.&nbsp; It has a method on it called <i>getClassicPort</i>
that returns a <b>classic::gov::cca::Port*</b>.&nbsp; Translation is handled
automatically: all you do is ask for a classic port by type, and it comes
to you wrapped in a PortTranslator.&nbsp; Moreover, you can decorate your
component with classic ports (like a <b>ParameterPort</b>) by wrapping the
classic port in a PortTranslator and exporting via <i>addProvidesPort</i>
in the usual way.&nbsp; The biggest headache comes from the fact that all
foreign entities must go through an opaque data type in Babel, and that translates
into a <b>void*</b>. &nbsp; Here is an <a
