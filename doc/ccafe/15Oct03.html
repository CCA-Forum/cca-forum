    <h1>Ccaffeine "lemur" Source and Build</h1>

<p>
The final feature set is in to Ccaffeine for SC03.  If you want to
    check it out get the version tagged "lemur":
<pre>
cvs -d  $USER@cca-forum.org:/cvs/ccaffeine/repository co -r lemur ccafe
</pre>
</p>
<p>
    The tar ball for Ccaffeine as of October 19, 2003 is located 
   <a href="http://cca-forum.org/download/ccafe">
      here</a>.  This includes Ccaffeine and the two specification
      directories: "cca-spec-babel" and "cca-spec-classic" (if you are
      only using "classic" you don't need the babel specification but
      you will get it anyway).  This does not include Babel which is
      available from <a
      href="http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/components/babel.html">here.</a>
      Only <a
      href="http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/components/docs/babel-0.8.6.tar.gz">
      Babel 0.8.6</a> or 0.8.7 are recommended.
</p>
    New Features:
<ul>
      <li> Python is now a configure parameter (--with-babel-python)
      and builds all of the python bindings to Ccaffeine in Babel.
      There is a special test (in ./ccafe/bin/test-python-bs) that checks the
      python bindings too.</li>

      <li> By binding the Port property "GoPort_Spawns_Thread" to
      "true", Ccaffeine will spawn a thread around that particular
      GoPort.  The other GoPorts will behave as they always
      have. There is also a test for this one in
      ./ccafe/bin/test-GoThread.  See
      ./ccafe/cxx/dc/component/GoThreadComponent.cxx for an example
      component.</li>

      <li> The xml .cca files that were largely defined by Boyana are
	now fully implemented and also end with the ".cca" extension.
	The old style .cca files will work as they did before. </li>

      <li> The "Goodbye Kiss" paradigm (<i>ComponentRelease</i>
      interface) is implemented for the Babel side of Ccaffeine but
      the classic side will remain the same.  Neoclassic will implement
      something similar when it gets off the ground. </i>
</ul>

<p>

    So here is the <a href="15Oct03/log.html"> log file</a> from the build if
    you are anxious to see it now.  A few words may be in order to
    explain it, though.  
</p>
    <p>
    This was built on my laptop using a uid I use
    only for this kind of testing.  This helps, but is still no
    guarantee that Rob or Ben-specific stuff didn't creep into the
    build.  Also, you will note that I did <b>not</b> use a prefix so
    all of the code is installed in the build direcories, but remember
    that even so, the <i> make install </i> directive is not optional, and
    little will work without it.  This also uses the normal mpich from
    Argonne and without the <i>mpd</i> daemon.  In this case you must
    use ssh or rsh configured properly for MPI to work.
