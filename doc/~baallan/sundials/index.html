<p>March 2005:
The SUNDIALS team at LLNL has determined not to follow up
on using Babel or CCA at this time. If you have an application
and would like to use SUNDIALS in Babel or CCA form,
please email radu@llnl.gov and Cc me (Ben).
</p>
<p>January 2005:
The sundials team at LLNL has imported our prototype and is
examining reimplementing everything in C rather than c++
for consistency with the rest of their package. We will post
an update here when we know better the status of that work.
All but the bravest of souls should probably wait for an
official sundials product rather than use the components available here.

<p><a href="sundials-sc04-v3.tgz">The alpha-3 release of BABEL/SIDL
wrapped (by Ben) CVODE (sundials from LLNL)</a>
is available for brave souls. See INSTALL in sundials-sc04.
This is based on a development version of sundials; we expect to
incorporate the babel/sidl bindings and maybe CCA bindings into 
an official sundials release. Features: 
<ol>
<li>Much improved configure support. got rid of hardcoded paths.</li>
<li> example wrapping of a real OO C
library in babel/sidl without *any* rewrite of the sundials code.</li>
<li> CCA CVODE factory component for the serial (uniprocessor) sundials
classes and generic (serial or parallel).</li>
<li> Implemented interfaces for parallel (MPI)
options in CVODE {hung up mainly on configure/build issues}.</li>
<li> Implemented interfaces for generic
(wrappers on user data structure) vector representations.</li>
<li> Added LinearSystem interface for arbitrary linear solvers
that use application-defined implementations of vectors.
</li>
<li>TODO: factory component for parallel vector wrappers.</li>
</ol>
