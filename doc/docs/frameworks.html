<span class="storytitle">CCA Frameworks</span>
<br />

<p>A component <I>framework</I> is the set of services that are
required to instantiate and manage components and the communications
among components.  The CCA standard does not specify a single
framework but instead specifies a minimal set of services required to
be CCA compliant.  Adding to the potential confusion, many of the
frameworks are themselves built using CCA components - but to prevent
infinite recursion they typically are self-instantiating. </p>

<p>Because of the wide range of scientific component research that CCA
addresses, multiple frameworks have been developed with differing
capabilities and restrictions.  Some of them are designed as research
vehicles to explore particular aspects of CCA, while others are built
as production systems.  Ultimately all of the capabilities will be
combined, either by augmenting one or more existing frameworks, or by
specifying <A
href="http://www.sc-2002.org/paperpdfs/pap.pap315.pdf">bridges</A>
between frameworks.  Recent work has concentrated on the second
approach, since it allows users to access features from other
frameworks while continuing to work with the framework with which they
are most comfortable.  A major division is between
<i>direct-connect</i> and <i>distributed</i> frameworks.  With some
exceptions, direct-connect frameworks do not have the ability to
manage components distributed on a wide area network, while
distributed frameworks do not have the ability to connect
non-isocardinal parallel components (e.g., to address the <A
href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~febertra/mxn/">MxN problem</A>).
(Note that "distributed framework" means one which supports
distributed components, and does not imply that the framework itself
is distributed code.)</p>

<p>Another major division is whether or not the framework uses the <A
href="http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/components/babel.html">Babel</A>
run-time system.  The reason not all CCA frameworks use Babel is that
some preceded Babel, and some use capabilities which Babel does not
yet provide.</p>

<p>Until framework bridging is completed, end users need to select a
framework.  This guide is meant to help in that task.</p>

<p><A href="../ccafe.1.html">CCAFFEINE</A> is a Sandia
product, and possibly the most commonly used one for complex
applications.  Ccaffeine supports parallel components running in the
same memory space, and can use Babel, or be used without Babel (the
"classic" version of Ccaffeine).  It does not yet support WAN
distributed parallel components.</p>

<p><A href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~febertra/mxn/">DCA</A> is an
Indiana University research framework for exploring the semantics of
parallel remote method invocation (PRMI) and working on the MxN
problem.  DCA provides an MPI-like interface for parallel transfers
and handles one-dimensional array data redistribution.  Because DCA
involves experimenting with the semantics of PRMI, it is not a
production framework.  DCA has a partial implementation of a SIDL
parser.</p>

<p><A
href="http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/components/docs/decaf.pdf">DECAFF</A>
is a Livermore framework originally developed to understand the CCA
specification and to verify SIDL and Babel.  Decafe is a
direct-connect framework and uses Babel as its run-time system.
Current work is bridging between Decafe and the distributed frameworks
Scirun2 and XCAT-C++.</p>

<!-- 
<A href="">DUNE</A> is a Los Alamos framework that supports and explores
primarily Fortran-95 components, and exposing the CCA services in an
interaction style more natural for Fortran programmers.
Dune is a direct-connect framework which doesn't use Babel.
-->

<p><A href="http://www.cca-forum.org/docs/ccain.sf.net">CCAIN</A><I> (note: this link may not work
yet&nbsp;it is awaiting approval by LANL)</I> is a Los Alamos
framework that emphasizes light-weight rapid development of components
with few requirements on the part of the component writers.  It uses
the Fortran 2003 interoperability specification to bridge to C, and
from there to Python and C++ via the usual <I> extern "C" </I> name
demangling mechanism.</p>

<p><A href="http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/xcat/">XCAT-JAVA</A> is an
Indiana University distributed framework which currently supports only
Java components and does not support parallel components.  XCAT-Java
uses the grid standard of <A
href="http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/xcat/publications/tr-xcat.pdf">
web services</A> for the distributed component interactions and is a
production framework.</p>

<a><A
href="http://grid.cs.binghamton.edu/projects/xcat.html">XCAT-C++</A>
is the C++ version of XCAT, which also provides components as web
services.  This framework is currently in transition from using SOAP
for the underlying inter-component communications to using the Proteus
multi-protocol library.  XCAT-C++ has its own stub and skeleton
generator which uses SIDL descriptions of the components.  It does not
support distributed parallel components or the MxN problem, even in
the non-distributed case.</p>

<p><A href="http://software.sci.utah.edu/scirun.html">SCIRUN-2</A> is
a distributed framework that supports parallel components using a
restricted subset of MxN interactions, and handles data redistribution
automatically.  This production framework is also being bridged to
Babel and hence to other CCA frameworks.</p>
