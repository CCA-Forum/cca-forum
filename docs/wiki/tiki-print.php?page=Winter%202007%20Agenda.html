<div class="titlebar">Wednesday 24 Jan 2007, Begin 12:00pm</div>
There are two working group meetings on Wednesday January 24 2007 from 12:00 pm till 5:00 pm.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">MCMD Mini-workshop:</span></b> (12:00n-5:00pm PT)<br />
<br />
CCA's support for emerging hardware and software paradigms for high-end computing is one element of the new TASCS project. One of the primary focus areas in this initiative is support for massive levels of parallelism through what we call &quot;multiple component-multiple data&quot; (MCMD) programming. MCMD, by analogy with the more traditional MPMD programming, involves the coordination of multiple different parallel tasks running within the same application. The goal of TASCS's MCMD work is to design and implement a &quot;standard&quot; infrastructure that builds on the natural encapsulation provided by components to allow developers of a broad range of applications easily access the MCMD programming style in their component-based simulations.<br />
<br />
This is a mini-workshop to be held in conjunction with the January CCA Forum meeting to collect application requirements and begin the design process. If you would like to add an agenda item (or would like to talk about application requirements) for the MCMD workshop feel free to add, and please let <a class="wiki"  href="mailto:manoj@pnl.gov"> Manoj Krishnan</a> know. If you are planning to attend, please add your name in the participants list below.<br />

<b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">CQoS Working Group Meeting:</span></b> (1:30pm-5:00pm PT)<br />
<br />
As computational science progresses towards ever more realistic multiphysics and multiscale applications, the complexity is becoming such that no single research group can effectively select or tune all of the components in a given application, and no single tool, solver, or solution strategy can seamlessly span the entire spectrum efficiently. Common component interfaces enable easy access to suites of independently developed algorithms and implementations.  The challenge then becomes how to make sound choices dynamically during runtime among the available implementations and parameters, suitably compromising among performance, accuracy, mathematical consistency, and reliability.<br />
<br />
CCA researchers are addressing this challenge by developing tools for  Computational Quality of Service (CQoS), or the automatic selection and configuration of components to suit a particular computational purpose.  The CQoS Working Group will meet from 1:30 pm - 5:00 pm on January 24, where the agenda will include taking stock of motivating applications, getting updates on recent work, and making plans for future activities.<br />

the project-team PARIS (INRIA, Rennes, France), like NxM components and<br />
automatic component deployment. The second part of the talk will be<br />
about the support of the Master-Worker<a href="tiki-editpage.php%3Fpage=Master-Worker.html" title="Create page: Master-Worker" class="wiki wikinew">?</a> paradigm in component models and<br />
more particularly in CCA.<br />

Tammy Dahlgren, LLNL<br />
<br />
This talk presents preliminary results showing execution time costs of interface contract enforcement using the new global enforcement scheme.  Data for single-component programs were collected using Babel-generated enforcement traces.  The status of integrating these new capabilities into the Babel repository will be summarized.<br />

<br />
I will present a brief review of recent progress in a Babel RMI library implementation using CORBA IIOP.<br />
<br />
<b>CCA 1.0 Release Criteria Task Force</b><br />
Gary Kumfert, LLNL<br />
<br />
The CCA specification must progress to a legitimate 1.0 release in a timely fashion.  Babel was very successful with its process of publicly generating and maintaining its own 1.0 release criteria document.  Gary will discuss how this worked for Babel, and areas where it will probably be different for CCA.  Building on <a class="wiki"  href="tiki-index.php%3Fpage=Toward+a+1.0+Environment.html"> Ben's earlier work from the Spring 06 meeting</a>, Gary will seek to constitute a task force to complete first draft of CCA 1.0 release criteria for the Spring meeting.<br />

Rob Armstrong (SNL),Wael Elwasif (ORNL),Ben Allan (SNL), Boyana Norris (ANL)<br />
<br />
This is mainly a demo and some speculation on this tool's eventual functionality (demo if the code is in a running state, that is).<br />
<br />
I'll briefly review recent progress in low-level integration of quantum chemistry packages and take a look at some mildly interesting performance data.  How low can you go?<br />

Wael Elwasif, ORNL<br />
<br />
The CCA Tools are working on the CRAY XT3!  I will share a little of the experience with this port, many aspects of which will be relevant to other high-end systems (like Blue Gene/L).  I will discuss some of the outstanding issues we need to address in order to make building and using the CCA Tools on such platforms routine.<br />
