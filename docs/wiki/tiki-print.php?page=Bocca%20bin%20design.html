The problem is to how to install the tools, and once installed, how they determine context information.<br />
<br />
The prior competing approaches are:<br />
<ul><li> .svn or CVS like-- context is entirely in the directory and a single install of the bocca utilities can cover the whole machine.
</li><li> rails-like where each project gets its own installed copy of the tools.
</li></ul>
<br />
The CVS-like approach suffers from versioning: what if the system maintainer installs a new version of bocca and we've changed something internally? This fails the use-case where one project migrates and another doesn't. Of course the supercomputing centers get around this with 'modules' or equivalent, but it's a real hassle, and the rest of us get stuck trying to figure out what PATH to set and having to change it constantly.<br />
<br />
The completely-rails-like approach avoids version issues, but suffers from a potential proliferation of PATH (mis)settings or variant names of executables and can subtly fail the use-case where the user wants to copy-modify an entire project tree.<br />
<br />
<br />
A resolution that handles both use-cases cleanly is:<br />
<br />
<ul><li> First we clean up everything in bocca data-files so that path relative-to-root is used. Without this, we fail the use-case of copy-and-modify to edit a project. Then we take the following steps to ensure we find the right root dir every time.
</li><li> Create a script (sh) named bocca that is small and very unlikely to change even if all the implementation details of the utility scripts and RC/config files do change. This script is installed as /usr/local/bin/bocca, or anywhere else the user wants. It's only job is to check context and dispatch to the boccalib that matches the context.
</li><li> When creating a bocca project (bocca init $PROJNAME), that project (optionally) gets a directory at its top-level named boccalib-$PROJNAME which contains the entire set of utilities installed in the usual pattern (bin/, share/, include/, lib, etc/ underneath).
</li><li> At the top of a bocca project is the RC (config?) file specific to that project (what components, ports, etc).
</li><li> In each directory where bocca scribbles on any kind of file within a project, a  .bocca/ subdir is created. In it is a file .bocca/Dir-$PROJNAME containing the relative path from the dir containing the RC file to the local dir. This is like CVS/Repository, but avoids the problems that you get if you copy the CVS/Entries file from one repository over another accidentally. Projects can arbitrarily cohabit the filesystem.
</li><li> (There was earlier proposed a .bocca/Root-PROJ file which proved to be both painful and unnecessary.)
</li></ul>
<br />
The proposed approach captures the context, allows the user run without PATH juggling, and allows checking of critical and likely user misbehaviors:<br />
<ul><li> copying one component to another directory to modify without going through 'bocca clone component'.
</li><li> copying an entire project to modify (which isn't really misbehavior at all).
</li><li> installing a conflicting version of bocca.
</li><li> running different bocca projects in the same directory tree (provided our RC filename at the top includes $PROJNAME for disambiguation, and provided we have an option for specifying which PROJNAME any command issued applies to if it is ambiguous).
</li><li> copying a bocca component on top of another bocca component in the directory tree.
</li></ul>
<br />
Further this allows the users of bocca to keep their RC file under version control and rebootstrap the rest of the boccalib whereever they move their source code-- neither we nor they will want them keeping bocca utility scripts under their version control in most cases.<br />

<br />
I like this overall, and especially avoiding the PATH madness. I need to think more about the details, but I can't see anything problematic.<br />
<br />
<div class="titlebar">Additional corner case</div>
<br />
The case where two projects are rooted in the same directory means each cannot have its own independent boccalib unless we rename boccalib to boccalib-$PROJNAME. This is precisely the case if we truly want to support overlay behavior sanely. This makes the hard things possible without making the simple things annoying.<br />
